      " ### The “Agent Loop”\n",
      "\n",
      "In the field of artificial‑intelligence and autonomous systems, an **agent loop** (sometimes called the **sense‑think‑act cycle**) is the recurring process that an agent follows in order to operate in its environment. The loop can be broken down into three core stages:\n",
      "\n",
      "| Stage | What Happens | Typical Implementation |\n",
      "|-------|--------------|------------------------|\n",
      "| **Sense (Perceive)** | The agent gathers data from its surroundings through sensors, APIs, cameras, microphones, etc. | Raw sensor readings → preprocessing (filtering, normalization) |\n",
      "| **Think (Decide/Plan)** | Using the perceived information, the agent updates its internal state, evaluates goals, and selects an action. This may involve reasoning, planning, learning, or optimization. | Rule‑based inference, reinforcement‑learning policy, symbolic planner, LLM prompt, etc. |\n",
      "| **Act (Execute)** | The chosen action is carried out on the environment—sending commands, manipulating objects, generating text, etc. | Actuator commands, API calls, UI interactions, robot motor commands |\n",
      "\n",
      "After the act step, the environment changes, new observations become available, and the loop starts again. Because the loop repeats continuously (often many times per second for real‑time robots, or at a slower cadence for chat‑based agents), the agent can adapt to dynamic conditions, recover from mistakes, and progressively work toward its objectives.\n",
      "\n",
      "A simple pseudocode illustration:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "while not goal_reached:\n",
      "    observation = sense()               # 1️⃣ Perception\n",
      "    state      = update_state(observation)\n",
      "    action     = decide(state)          # 2️⃣ Reasoning / Planning\n",
      "    act(action)                         # 3️⃣ Execution\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why it matters**\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Modularity** – Each stage can be swapped out (e.g., replace a rule‑based planner with a neural network) without redesigning the whole system.\n",
      "- **Feedback** – The loop creates a natural feedback mechanism; the outcome of an action becomes the next observation.\n",
      "- **Scalability** – Complex agents are built by nesting loops (high‑level strategic loop ↔ low‑level motor loop) or by running multiple loops in parallel (e.g., perception thread, planning thread, actuation thread).\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### How Wikipedia Describes “Autonomous Agents”\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Wikipedia’s entry for **“Autonomous agent”**:\n",
      "\n",
      "> **An autonomous agent is an artificial intelligence (AI) system that can perform complex tasks independently.**  \n",
      "\n",
      "In other words, an autonomous agent:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Acts without continuous human supervision** – once it is given a goal or a set of constraints, it decides on its own how to achieve the goal.\n",
      "2. **Perceives its environment** – it gathers information through sensors or data streams.\n",
      "3. **Makes decisions and plans** – it uses reasoning, learning, or optimization techniques to choose actions that advance its objectives.\n",
      "4. **Executes actions** – it interacts with the world (software or physical) to bring about change.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Wikipedia description emphasizes the *independence* of the system: the agent is capable of **self‑directed behavior** and can handle the full sense‑think‑act cycle without needing a human to intervene at each step. This aligns directly with the agent‑loop model: the loop is the operational engine that gives an autonomous agent its ability to act independently.\n"
